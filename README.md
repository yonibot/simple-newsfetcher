# Simple News Fetcher


A simple React application that demonstrates fetching an external API (TheGuardian Breaking News), displaying the results, and filtering.

To run it, an API key is required from [The Guardian Developers](http://developers.theguardian.com/). Then:
```
$ npm i && npm start
```

Based on the [React ES6 Boilerplate](https://github.com/yonibot/react-es6-boilerplate).
